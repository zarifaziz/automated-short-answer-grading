       "'\\n\\n\\nRole: Academic Tutor\\n    Task: Make an assessment of the student\\'s answer by comparing it with the reference answer.\\n    You are essentially assessing whether the student\\'s answer was correct, or needs additional feedback.\\n    \\n    The value for assessment must be EXACTLY one of the following classes:\\n    \"correct\", \"partially_correct_incomplete\", \"contradictory\", \"non_domain\", \"irrelevant\"\\n    Include the underscores if the class contains it.\\n\\n    Definitions of the classes:\\n    - correct: if the student answer is a complete and correct paraphrase of the reference answer\\n    - partially_correct_incomplete: if it is a partially correct answer containing some but not\\n    all information from the reference answer\\n    - contradictory: if the student answer explicitly contradicts the reference answer\\n    - irrelevant:  if the student answer is talking about domain content but not providing the necessary information\\n    - non_domain: if the student utterance does not include domain content, e.g., “I don’t know”, “what the book says”, “you are stupid”\\n\\n    The \"question\" field doesn\\'t provide too much context apart from the final few words of the problem.\\n    So don\\'t focus on the question too much.\\n\\n---\\n\\nFollow the following format.\\n\\nQuestion: ${question}\\n\\nStudent Answer: ${student_answer}\\n\\nReference Answer: ${reference_answer}\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to ${produce the assessment}. We ...\\n\\nAssessment: the final assessment\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Why was bulb A on when switch Y was open and switch Z was closed?\\n\\nStudent Answer: the battery was contained in a circut\\n\\nReference Answer: Bulb A is still contained in a closed path with the battery.\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the assessment. We can see that the student\\'s answer is partially correct, as they mention the battery being contained in a circuit, but they do not mention the switch Y being open and switch Z being closed. Therefore, the student\\'s answer is partially correct but incomplete.\\n\\nAssessment: partially_correct_incomplete\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: When switch X was closed and switch Y was open, why was bulb A on?\\n\\nStudent Answer: It has its own closed path\\n\\nReference Answer: Bulb A was still contained in the same closed path with the battery.\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the assessment. We can see that the student\\'s answer is partially correct, as it correctly identifies that bulb A is in its own closed path. However, it does not mention that this closed path is still connected to the battery, which is an important detail. Therefore, the assessment should be \"partially_correct_incomplete\".\\n\\nAssessment: partially_correct_incomplete\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain your reasoning.\\n\\nStudent Answer: i dont know\\n\\nReference Answer: A and C are in different paths with the battery\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the assessment. We can see that the student answer is not providing any relevant information about the paths or the battery. Therefore, it is not a complete answer and does not contain any domain content.\\n\\nAssessment: non_domain\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.\\n\\nStudent Answer: i dont know\\n\\nReference Answer: Terminal 1 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap\\n\\nReasoning: Let\\'s think step by step in order to produce the assessment. We can see that the student answer does not provide any relevant information about the connection between terminal 1 and the positive terminal. They simply state that they do not know, which does not address the question at all. Therefore, the student answer falls under the non_domain class.\\n\\nAssessment: non_domain\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Under what circumstances will a switch affect a bulb?\\nStudent Answer: it will turn it off\\nReference Answer: When the switch and the bulb are contained in the same path\\nAssessment: irrelevant\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Describe the paths in this diagram and explain how those paths account for the results.\\nStudent Answer: Bulb B and Bulb C are contained in a closed path.\\nReference Answer: Bulb A is in a path which does not contain B and C, so bulbs B and C don\\'t affect it. Bulbs B and C are in the same path. They affect each other, but Bulb A doesn\\'t affect them.\\nAssessment: partially_correct_incomplete\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 2 and the positive terminal.\\nStudent Answer: The positive battery terminal is seperated by a gap from termnial one.\\nReference Answer: Terminal 2 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap\\nAssessment: irrelevant\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain your reasoning.\\nStudent Answer: tell answer\\nReference Answer: If bulb A burns out, B and C are no longer in a closed path with the battery\\nAssessment: non_domain\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: What do you think the red X means?\\nStudent Answer: don\"t do it.\\nReference Answer: the battery is damaged\\nAssessment: irrelevant\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: As you move the multimeter leads from one bulb terminal to the next, what does it mean when the voltage reading jumps from 0 to 1.5?\\nStudent Answer: There is a difference in electrical states.\\nReference Answer: the bulb is damaged\\nAssessment: partially_correct_incomplete\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: As you move the multimeter leads from one bulb terminal to the next, what does it mean when the voltage reading jumps from 0 to 1.5?\\nStudent Answer: there terminals are separated by a gap when the voltage jumps from 0 to 1.5.\\nReference Answer: the bulb is damaged\\nAssessment: correct\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 1 and terminal 4.\\nStudent Answer: terminal 1 is connected to terminal 4.\\nReference Answer: Terminals 1 and 4 are connected\\nAssessment: correct\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Why does measuring voltage help you locate a burned out bulb? Try to answer in terms of electrical states, connections and/ or a gap.\\nStudent Answer: there will be a gap between the positive battery terminal and the bulb terminal\\nReference Answer: Measuring voltage indicates the place where the electrical state changes due to a gap.\\nAssessment: contradictory\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why circuit 4 is not a short circuit.\\nStudent Answer: Because neither of the components are connected to themselves.\\nReference Answer: Circuit 4 has no closed paths\\nAssessment: partially_correct_incomplete\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 0 for terminal 6 and the positive terminal.\\nStudent Answer: i dont know\\nReference Answer: Terminal 6 and the positive terminal are connected\\nAssessment: non_domain\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 1 and the positive terminal.\\nStudent Answer: Because the meter was hooked up to two sides of the battery.\\nReference Answer: Terminal 1 and the positive terminal are not connected\\nAssessment: contradictory\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Explain why you got a voltage reading of 1.5 for terminal 3 and the positive terminal.\\nStudent Answer: The positive battery terminal is separated by a gap from terminal 1. and germinal 3 is connected to the negative battery termina\\nReference Answer: Terminal 3 and the positive terminal are separated by the gap\\nAssessment: correct\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: As you move the multimeter leads from one bulb terminal to the next, what does it mean when the voltage reading jumps from 0 to 1.5?\\nStudent Answer: jdkjgkfjg\\nReference Answer: the bulb is damaged\\nAssessment: non_domain\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: When switch X was closed and switch Y was open, why was bulb A on?\\nStudent Answer: because it was contained in same path as the battery\\nReference Answer: Bulb A was still contained in the same closed path with the battery.\\nAssessment: partially_correct_incomplete\\n\\n---\\n\\nQuestion: Why do you think those terminals and the negative battery terminal are in the same state?\\nStudent Answer: they are have 0 volts.\\nReference
